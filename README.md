Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project focuses on performing Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the structure, patterns, and key insights from the data. It is part of a data science internship task.

📊 Project Overview
The goal is to:

Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset.

Explore statistical properties and distributions.

Uncover patterns related to survival rates.

Visualize relationships using plots and graphs.

📁 Files in this Repository
task02 - EDA-checkpoint.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook performing the full EDA.

(Optional) titanic.csv: The dataset used for analysis. (Not included here, but assumed to be available in the working directory.)

🔍 Key Steps in Analysis
Loading and Understanding Data

Loaded the Titanic dataset.

Displayed basic information and statistical summaries.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Converted categorical variables to appropriate types.

Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzed survival distribution.

Explored relationships between survival and features like Sex, Age, Pclass, SibSp, Fare, and Embarked.

Visualized patterns using bar plots, histograms, and box plots.
